What's the difference between fopen() and open()?
The difference between open() and fopen() is that open() is a system call and it returns an int which is used as a  file descriptor while fopen() opens the file using a C library and it returns a pointer to a FILE.

Why does the library method make different system calls?
The library method makes different system calls because it needs more information about the file in order to create a FILE pointer.
